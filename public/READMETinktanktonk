After attempting to get my bearings, I'm now ready to dive into the curl scripts.  It feels slightly overwhelming at this point, but only when I go beyond where I am.  With that, I'm attempting to stay within the step I'm on.  Here we go curl sciprts.

First up : Sign up

Updated the apiUrls n config.js

6-7-20  Sunday morning into Sunday evening.

After a little debug session with Areesh on Slack this morning, we figured out that the word passowrd should be spelled password.  This fixed all of the errors and I was able to run all of my curl-scripts successfully.  Yay!

Now, I'm going to build up a wire frame and then put some html together.

Story:  My first move is to get every piece on the screen and working.  Once that is done, I'll organize and adapt the content to a better design and format.
