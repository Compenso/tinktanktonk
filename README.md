6-15-20  Still having some trouble understanding the game index store logic, but feel that I'm coming closer to a much deeper and detailed relationship.

Previously, I jumped into what I know, skipped what was confusing, and addressed what concerned me most.

Curl scripts were what I understood.  Mostly and/or partly.

The game index store still confuses me, but it feels closer now to understanding.

The javascript concerned me the most.  I was having trouble learning how js worked and how to use it.  Conceptually I thought it was easy, but syntactually I wasn't tracking.

So, from the near top.

Going to work through the reading and the game.store.index items in order to recall a game.

Most of the ajax call setup is done.  Game data is being stored for each user.  Clicks are being counted.
I need to write lines for the rest of the get games data and then build out some checks for the boxes so they can't overwrite each other.
As a current player, I want to see whose turn it is.
As a user, I want to be able to see when a win occurs.

As a user, I want to be able to sign up.
After I have signed up, I want to be able to sign in.
As a user, I want to be able to play a new game.
After a game has been played to completion, or not, I want to be able to clear the board by starting a new game.
As a user, I want to be able to get an old game using the id.
As a user, I want to be able to get a game using the id of the game.


*** Still trying to merge the branches with the master.

Finally figured out how to merge with the master last night.
I encountered some new errors this morning.  Debugging now.
And then, as a user, I want to be able to track each game's state.

Trying to work through tracking my games and my game's states.  I'm hanging out in the handleCellPlayed function.  It must send it's information to the api and the form field.

1:30 now.  I think I need to setup my 'PATCH'.  Reading through the docs one more time...

Happy Father's Day!!!!  Dang.  That was a process from switchback hell.
Nearing the finish line though.  Fought process and understanding the whole way.

Maybe missed a few days.  The javascript!!!!  Damn.  It's so easy to look at other written code and get it, but looking at my own???  This method.  Bugger!
